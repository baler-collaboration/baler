# Introduction
Baler is a tool used to test the feasibility of compressing different types of scientific data using machine learning-based autoencoders. Baler provides you with an easy way to:
1. Train a machine learning model on your data
2. Compress your data with that model, and save the model
3. Decompress the file using the model at a later time


# Getting Started #
Baler now exists as a *pip package* which you can install through:
```console
pip install baler-compressor
```

For examples on how to use Baler we recommend following the tutorial from our baler-demo repository: https://github.com/baler-collaboration/baler-demo
